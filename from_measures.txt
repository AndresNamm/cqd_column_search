|PSTN Incoming Post Dial Delay | Milliseconds | The time or delay that occurs on incoming calls measured from the time a number is dialed until the caller or called party hears ringing.|
|PSTN NER Good Percentage | Percentage | The NER measures the ability of a network to deliver calls by measuring the number of calls sent versus the number of calls delivered to a recipient.<br/>NER = (Answered calls + User Busy + Ring no Answer + Terminal Reject Seizures) / Total Attempt Calls x 100. There's an up to 0.2% error for this measure. See note below for details.|
| Avg Auto Attendant Chain Duration Seconds | Integer | The average duration that users spend in the Auto Attendant, measured in seconds. |
| Avg Call Queue Duration Seconds | Integer | The average duration that users are waiting for a Call Queue to be answered by an agent, measured in seconds. |
|Total Teams Events Stream Count|Integer|The total number of Teams Events streams.|
|Teams Events ECDN Error Stream Count|Integer|The total number of Teams Events streams that failed to establish due to eCDN errors.|
|Teams Events Setup Failure Stream Count|Integer|The number or Teams Events streams that failed to establish during media setup.|
|Teams Events Setup Succeeded Stream Count|Integer|The number or Teams Events streams that successfully established.|
|Teams Events Stream Setup Failure Percentage|Percentage|The percentage of Teams Events steams that failed to establish during media setup.|
| Detected Inbound Network Problem True Count | Integer | Number of instances that there's high confidence that a First-to-Second media stream might be impacted due to the inbound network. |
| Detected Inbound Network Problem False Count | Integer | Number of instances that there isn't high confidence that a First-to-Second media stream might be impacted due to the inbound network. |
| Detected Inbound Network Problem Null Count | Integer | Number of instances that the Detected Inbound Network Problem model returned a null value. See Detected Inbound Network Problem dimension for explanation. |
| Detected Inbound Network Problem Rate | Percentage | Percentage of streams for which there is high confidence that a First-to-Second media stream might be impacted due to the inbound network. |
| Avg First Healed Data Ratio Value | Percentage (Decimal) | Percentage of the audio stream in which the audio healer on the first endpoint is invoked, averaged across the number of streams in a given row. High HDR indicates that the client expected audio but Teams didn't have any content to play back. High healer usage is experienced by end-users as choppy audio. This measurement isn't currently calculated for WebRTC-based clients. |
| Avg Second Healed Data Ratio Value | Percentage (Decimal) | Percentage of the audio stream in which the audio healer on the second endpoint is invoked, averaged across the number of streams in a given row. High HDR indicates that the client expected audio but Teams didn't have any content to play back. High healer usage is experienced by end-users as choppy audio. This measurement isn't currently reported by WebRTC-based clients. |
| Avg First Received Audio Seconds | Seconds (Decimal) | Amount of active audio received by the first endpoint in seconds, excluding silence. This measurement isn't currently reported by WebRTC based clients. |
| Avg Second Received Audio Seconds | Seconds (Decimal) | Amount of active audio received by the second endpoint in seconds, excluding silence. This measurement isn't currently reported by WebRTC based clients. |
| Avg First Input Noise Level | dBFS (Decimal) | The RMS noise level of the audio signal Teams receives from the first capture device as measured in dBFS. |
| Avg Second Input Noise Level | dBFS (Decimal) | The RMS noise level of the audio signal Teams receives from the second capture device as measured in dBFS. |
| Avg First Input Speech Level | dBFS (Decimal) |The RMS level of the speech detected in the audio signal Teams receives from the first capture device as measured in dBFS. |
| Avg Second Input Speech Level | dBFS (Decimal) | The RMS level of the speech detected in the audio signal Teams receives from the second capture device as measured in dBFS. |
